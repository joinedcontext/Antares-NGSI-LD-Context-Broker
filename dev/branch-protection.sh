# Applies the branch model of CONTRIBUTING.md to the GitHub repository,

#
#   dev    — default branch. Maintainers push, everyone else opens a pull
#            request that lands by rebase or squash with ci.yml green.
#            No force push, no deletion, linear history.
#   main — released code. Pull request only (from dev), full.yml green,
#            merge commit only, no force push, no deletion.
#   v*     — release tags. Once pushed, never moved and never deleted.
#
# Needs a token with Administration: write on the repository, in GH_TOKEN
# or ~/.config/antares/gh-token. Rulesets bind on a public repository (or
# a paid plan), so run it once the repository is public. Idempotent: an
# existing dev branch is kept and a ruleset of the same name is replaced.
#
# Review count is 0 on purpose: a sole maintainer cannot approve their own
# pull request, so requiring one would deadlock every promotion. Raise it
# when a second maintainer joins.

Done. By hand, in the repository settings:
 - General → Pull Requests: allow merge commits, squash and rebase (the
   rulesets narrow them per branch).
Every clone: git fetch && git switch dev
