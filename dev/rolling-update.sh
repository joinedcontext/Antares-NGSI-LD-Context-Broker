# Rolling update across the HA pair — one instance at a time,
# using the antares-local:latest image the pipeline just built. Same script
# locally and in CI (the one-pipeline rule).
#
# Precondition: the HA stack is up —
#   docker compose -f compose-files/docker-compose-etsi.yml \
#                  -f compose-files/docker-compose-ha.yml [--profile db] up -d
#
# ROLES_SPLIT=1: roll the 10-pod role fleet
# (docker-compose-roles.yml) instead of the HA pair, in role-group order —
# api, matcher, notifier, temporal, registry. The invariant is per GROUP:
# the peer of the same role must be healthy before its twin goes down, so no
# role ever has 0 live pods. api pods are judged by /q/health + the LB rise
# window (the drain contract); workers serve ops endpoints only and are
# judged by /q/ready.
#
# Per instance the sequence is exactly the drain contract:
#   docker compose stop  -> SIGTERM -> broker flips /q/health to 503, haproxy
#   ejects it within 400 ms, in-flight requests finish, process exits 0
#   (stop_grace_period 30 s > drain delay + deadline, set in the overlay)
#   docker compose up -d -> recreates on the current image
#   wait for /q/health 200 on its private port, then a rise window so the LB
#   has re-admitted it BEFORE the next instance goes down — never 0 healthy.
#
# Env:
#   STORE=memory|postgres|timescale   selects the db profile (default memory)
