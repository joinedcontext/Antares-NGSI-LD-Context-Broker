"""1 Hz CPU/RSS sampler for the ETSI stack, labelled with the running suite.

Reads /proc/<container pid>/{stat,status} directly rather than shelling out to
`docker stats`: a `docker stats --no-stream` call costs ~1 s of its own (it
samples twice to compute CPU%), which makes a 1 s cadence impossible, and it
reports "0B / 0B" under a nested daemon with no delegated memory cgroup. The
container pid is visible in our own /proc because the daemon is our child.

Emits `ts,iso,container,phase,cpu_pct,rss_mib` — one row per container per
tick, flushed every tick so a SIGKILLed sampler still leaves complete data.
`phase` is read from --phase-file on every tick (the suite runner writes the
suite name there), which is what lets a spike be traced back to the suite that
caused it. Per-TEST attribution is a post-processing join on `ts` against the
Robot output.xml timestamps — see the report step in dev/etsi-pipeline.sh.

Main-pid CPU only (the broker is one process); sum the cgroup if a
role ever forks workers.
