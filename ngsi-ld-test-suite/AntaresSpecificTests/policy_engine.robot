Documentation       Verify the policy seam end to end, against a broker built

...
...                 ANTARES DECISION, NOT A CIM 009 REQUIREMENT. CIM 009 gives
...                 the broker no authorization model: clause 4.13 leaves
...                 security to the deployment and Table 6.3.2-1 names no
...                 access-denied error. So a refusal here answers this
...                 broker's own `urn:antares:error:AccessDenied` rather than
...                 an `https://uri.etsi.org/` type it would be inventing, and
...                 a narrowed answer is marked with an `Antares-` header.
...
...                 The reason the seam exists is that three narrowings cannot
...                 be done by the gateway in front: the query the store runs,
...                 one subscription's notification, and a federated result
...                 before it is rendered (ADR-0020). Everything else stays in
...                 the gateway, and the broker ships exactly one engine —
...                 allow-all — with every other one an addon outside
...                 `crates/`, which is what this file exercises.
...
...                 The rules the run is started with:
...                 tenant `acme` denies the Entity type `PolicySecret` and
...                 omits the Attribute `price`; tenant `beta` conjoins
...                 `speed<100` into every query; every other tenant is
...                 unrestricted.

A Denied Entity Type Is Refused With 403
    [Documentation]    The engine refuses `PolicySecret` for this tenant, and
    ...    the refusal is a 403 carrying the broker's own error type — not a
    ...    404 that would hide a policy decision behind a spec error, and not
    ...    an ETSI error type for a condition CIM 009 does not name.

    Should Be Equal As Strings    ${response.json()}[type]    urn:antares:error:AccessDenied

An Allowed Entity Type In The Same Tenant Still Lands
    [Documentation]    The refusal has to be the engine's rule and not the
    ...    seam refusing everything: the same tenant, one type further, is a
    ...    201. A test asserting only the 403 would pass against a broker
    ...    that had stopped serving.

A Filtered Query Hides The Entity It Excludes
    [Documentation]    The engine conjoins `speed<100` into this tenant's
    ...    queries, so the fast Entity is not in the answer at all — the
    ...    narrowing runs in the store, which is why it cannot be done by the
    ...    gateway in front. The answer says it was narrowed.

An Omitted Attribute Is Absent From The Answer
    [Documentation]    The other narrowing the engine asks for: `price` is
    ...    projected out of what this tenant is served. The Entity was created
    ...    whole — a filter narrows an answer, never a write — so the
    ...    Attribute is in the store and not in the response.

A Forbidden Attribute Is Absent From A Notification
    [Documentation]    The third narrowing: a notification is projected by the
    ...    engine before it is sent. The subscription asks for both
    ...    Attributes; the engine's omit list takes one away, and the other
    ...    still arrives — a notification the engine dropped whole would
    ...    satisfy an assertion that only looked for the absence.

A Subject Header Never Reaches A Context Source
    [Documentation]    The subject the engine is told about is assembled from

    ...    registration naming one in contextSourceInfo is 4.3.6.5's own
