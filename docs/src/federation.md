# Federation

Antares implements the CIM 009 distributed-operations model (4.3.6,
5.9–5.11, 6.3.17, 6.3.18). Context Source Registrations (CSRs) are the
routing table: a broker holding CSRs forwards matching requests to the
registered sources, merges the answers and reports per-source problems
without failing the request. The DistributedOperations and IOP suites
(134 + 286 tests) cover this surface in every CI cell.

Every example below uses two brokers, `broker-a` on 9090 and `broker-b`
on 9091, as in `examples/federation/compose.yml`:

```bash
cd examples/federation && docker compose up -d && ./run.sh
```

`run.sh` creates an entity on B, registers B at A and queries A:

```text
entity created on B
CSR registered on A -> B
federated query via A:
[{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:ParkingSpot:fed:042","type":"ParkingSpot","status":{"type":"Property","value":"free"}}]
OK: B's entity served by A
```

With two local binaries instead of compose, set `ANTARES_HOST_ALIAS`
per process and run `B_FROM_A=http://localhost:9091 ./run.sh`.

## Registrations

A CSR declares what a source holds (`information[]`: entity types, ids,
`idPattern`, `propertyNames`, `relationshipNames`) and how to treat it
(`mode`):

| mode | meaning | reads | writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inclusive` (default) | one of possibly many holders | forwarded and merged (4.5.5) | forwarded, 207 on partial failure |
| `exclusive` | the only holder of the registered entity and attributes | forwarded | forwarded |
| `redirect` | the broker proxies, keeps nothing locally | forwarded | forwarded |
| `auxiliary` | consulted only when nobody else answers | forwarded last | never |

An `exclusive` registration names one entity id and its attributes
(4.3.6.3); a type-only or pattern registration is refused:

```text
{"detail":"an exclusive registration shall name an entity id — an id pattern or Entity type defining a group of entities is not supported (4.3.6.3)","status":400,"title":"BadRequestData", ...}
```

`operations` bounds what may be forwarded (default `federationOps`);
`contextSourceInfo` key/value pairs travel as headers on every forward
to that source (4.3.6.5); `localOnly` adds `local=true` to every
forward (4.3.6.4). `observationInterval` and `managementInterval` gate
temporal forwards to the sources whose window overlaps the query.

A `contextSourceInfo` value of `urn:ngsi-ld:request` is not sent as that
string: it copies the same-named header off the request that triggered the
forward, and sends nothing when the triggering request carried no such
header (4.3.6.5, 6.3.19). `{"key": "Authorization", "value":
"urn:ngsi-ld:request"}` is how a source behind the same identity provider is
given the caller's credential, and it is the reason creating a registration
is a privileged operation: the key names any header and the endpoint is
whatever the registration says. Two groups of keys never reach the source as
a raw header. Headers the registration's other members already decide take
precedence and cannot be overridden (6.3.19), which is `NGSILD-Tenant`, and
so do the ones the binding sets itself: `Host`, `Via`, `Link`, `Connection`,
`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`. The `accept`, `contentType`,
`jsonldContext` and `ngsildConformance` keys are the ones 4.3.6.6 and
4.3.6.8 give their own meaning; the forward acts on them, and passing them
through raw would corrupt the negotiation they steer.

A `contextSourceInfo` value goes on the wire and nowhere else. The broker
names the registration, and the endpoint with its userinfo stripped, in the
log line, the warning, the error body and the dead letter that a failed
forward produces; it never writes the pairs themselves, so a bearer token
handed over for one connection is not later readable from an operator's log
or from `/q/dead-letters`. The registration document itself still carries
the value, because 5.9.4 serves the registration back as it was written.

### The registered `@context`

`"jsonldContext"` names a `@context` the Context Source reads its terms in,
and the forward is recompacted into it: the payload, the term-bearing query
parameters (`attrs`, `type`, `geoproperty`) and — for the resources that
name one Attribute in the path, `/entities/{id}/attrs/{name}` and its
temporal and `value` variants — the path segment itself. The segment is not
one of the two things 4.3.6.6 lists, but it carries a term the Context
Source expands with the `@context` the forward advertises, so a request that
switched the context and left the segment alone would write to a different
Attribute.

The whole request travels in one `@context` or none of it does. A payload
the broker cannot express in the registered context — a batch array, a body
that does not re-expand — makes the forward fall back to the request's own
context, logged as a warning, because advertising the registered context
over terms that are not in it is how a peer writes Attributes nobody named.

### Timeout and cooldown

`management.timeout` (5.2.34) bounds one forward in milliseconds; the
broker caps it at 8 seconds, and a registration without it gets the cap.
`management.cooldown` keeps a source that failed out of the fan-out for
that many milliseconds; inside the window the forward is answered as a
timeout without contacting the source. A registration with
`"management": {"timeout": 500, "cooldown": 10000}` pointing at a closed
port answers in 7 ms:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Ngsild-Warning: 199 broker-b "no response was received from the registration endpoint within the timeout period"
```

### Forward history

Every forward that reaches the wire is booked on the registration it was
made for, in the five read-only members of Table 5.2.9-2:

```json
{
  "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceRegistration:weather",
  "type": "ContextSourceRegistration",
  "endpoint": "http://source-b:8080/ngsi-ld/v1",
  "information": [{"entities": [{"type": "WeatherObserved"}]}],
  "timesSent": 412,
  "timesFailed": 3,
  "lastSuccess": "2026-05-05T11:02:44.118Z",
  "lastFailure": "2026-05-04T22:17:09.640Z",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

`timesSent` counts every attempt, failures included; `timesFailed` counts
the ones the table calls failures, which in the HTTP binding is any response
code other than 2xx, a timeout and a refused connection. `status` names the
last attempt alone, so a source that has recovered reads `"ok"` however
large `timesFailed` is. A member appears when it first has something to say:
a registration that has never failed carries no `timesFailed` and no
`lastFailure`.

Three outcomes are deliberately not counted, because the operation never
left this broker: a destination the egress policy refuses, a source the
circuit breaker is holding open, and a registration inside its own
`management.cooldown` window. The breaker only opens after failures that
were attempted and booked, so a source that has gone away reads `"failed"`
before the first forward is suppressed.

They are read-only. A create or update that carries any of them has that
member dropped, not refused, which is what 5.2.9 asks for.

### Same source, several registrations

Registrations naming the same source (same endpoint, mode, tenant,
`contextSourceAlias`, `contextSourceInfo` and `localOnly`) fold into one
forwarded request whose attribute and entity scopes are the union. A
different `contextSourceAlias` behind the same endpoint is a different
source (5.2.9) and is contacted separately.

## Distributed reads

A read that matches CSRs fans out concurrently, `ANTARES_FED_FANOUT` at
a time (default 8), each forward bounded by the registration timeout and
`ANTARES_MAX_FED_RESPONSE_BYTES`. The forwarded request is narrowed to
what the registration declares (4.3.6.1): a registration with
`propertyNames: ["status"]` receives `attrs=status` even when the client
asked for `attrs=status,owner`, and any `owner` the source returns anyway
is dropped from the merge. The forward carries the `Via` hop and the
client's `Link` context, never the client's `NGSILD-Tenant` (4.14); the
registration's own `tenant` member names the tenant to address at the
source:

```text
GET /ngsi-ld/v1/entities?options=sysAttrs&type=ParkingSpot&attrs=status
Accept: application/json
Via: 1.1 broker-a
Link: <https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.9.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"
```

Entity halves from several sources merge per 4.5.5 before pagination.

### Partial failures

A source that fails does not fail the request. Each problem becomes one
`NGSILD-Warning` header (6.3.17, Table 6.3.17-1) naming the broker that
saw it:

| code | when |
|---|---|
| 199 | no response within the timeout, or the source is in cooldown |
| 299 | the source answered an error status other than 404 |
| 111 | the source answered 2xx with a payload that is not NGSI-LD |

A 404 from a source is a miss, not a warning. Warnings a peer returns
travel back to the client next to the broker's own, up to eight per
source (`maxPeerWarnings` in `/q/health`): the list is written by the
source but sent by this broker, and eight carries a real cascade without
letting one source outgrow the fan-out or bury what the broker has to
say about the others. A source that sends more has the rest dropped and
a line written to the log. Beyond the registration cooldown, a per-host
breaker pauses an endpoint whose forwards keep timing out; a source that
answers, even with an error, is never paused.

## Distributed writes

Writes forward by registration mode and the registered `operations`.
An `exclusive` or `redirect` registration whose `operations` exclude the
write is an error of type Conflict (409), because the data lives only
there; an `inclusive` one that excludes it is skipped. Batch operations
return per-entity success and error arrays with the remote results
folded in; a partial failure across inclusive sources is 207.

## Loop protection

Every forward carries a `Via` hop (6.3.18) whose pseudonym is this
broker's alias for the tenant (ADR-0011): `ANTARES_HOST_ALIAS` for the
default tenant, `{alias}~{tenant}` otherwise. `/info/sourceIdentity`
answers the same value per tenant, and that is what a peer stores as the
registration's `contextSourceAlias`:

```text
GET /ngsi-ld/v1/info/sourceIdentity
{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceIdentity:broker-a","type":"ContextSourceIdentity","contextSourceAlias":"broker-a", ...}

GET /ngsi-ld/v1/info/sourceIdentity   NGSILD-Tenant: odpady
{"id":"urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceIdentity:broker-a~odpady","type":"ContextSourceIdentity","contextSourceAlias":"broker-a~odpady", ...}
```

Two rules follow from the inbound chain:

- A registration whose `contextSourceAlias` already appears in the chain
  is not a matching registration (Table 6.3.18-2); the request has been
  there.
- A request whose chain names this broker itself runs locally without
  re-forwarding. When the only matching registration for a write is a
  single `exclusive` or `redirect` source, the loop closes on data that
  lives nowhere else and the answer is 508 (6.3.17):

```text
POST /ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Loop:1/attrs   Via: 1.1 broker-b
HTTP/1.1 508 Loop Detected
{"detail":"the Via chain already contains this broker","status":508,"title":"Loop Detected", ...}
```

A chain longer than 32 hops is treated as a loop whatever it names.
Replicas of one logical broker behind a load balancer share one alias on
purpose; they are one hop. Changing an alias breaks every peer's loop
detection, so treat it as a published identifier.

## Context source subscriptions

`POST /csourceSubscriptions` (5.11) watches the registrations instead of
the entities. A subscription on `ParkingSpot` receives the matching
registrations at creation and each later change with a `triggerReason`:

```json
{"id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceNotification:bafc4692-…", "type": "ContextSourceNotification",
 "subscriptionId": "urn:ngsi-ld:Subscription:csr-watch", "notifiedAt": "2026-08-26T16:02:43.945Z",
 "triggerReason": "newlyMatching",
 "data": [{"id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceRegistration:broker-c", "type": "ContextSourceRegistration",
           "endpoint": "http://localhost:9092", "information": [{"entities": [{"type": ["ParkingSpot"]}]}]}]}
```

`csf` filters registrations by their Context Source Properties (4.9).

## Distributed subscriptions

An entity subscription whose scope matches CSRs is reduced per source and
created at the remote broker (5.8); the remote notifies back to
`POST {ANTARES_PUBLIC_URL}/ex/v1/remote-notify`, so set that variable
whenever the default `http://{host_alias}:{port}` is not routable from
peers. That endpoint is the one non-standard route a federated deployment
must leave reachable from its context sources: CIM 009 defines no path for
it (5.8.1.4 says only that the copy carries "the notification endpoint of
the local Broker", and 5.2.15 makes a notification endpoint any URI), so it
lives outside the `/ngsi-ld` prefix ETSI owns rather than inside it, and it
is versioned on its own (ADR-0019). Other brokers place it elsewhere:
Orion-LD and coraine serve `POST /ngsi-ld/ex/v1/notifications/{subId}`,
Scorpio `POST /remotenotify/{id}`.

What arrives there is routed by the mapping alone. The forwarded copy
carries a broker-generated subscription id, never the subscriber's own, so
a context source learns nothing about the subscriber and cannot address any
other subscription; the tenant comes from the stored mapping and not from
the request, and the notified entities are re-filtered against the local
subscription's own selector before delivery. Reduced copies
follow the local subscription's lifecycle (update, delete); the
registration's `csf` gates which sources take part. Inbound
notifications from peers are matched against local subscriptions like
local changes.

## Pagination without amplification

The first distributed query can build an EntityMap (5.14): entity id to
contributing registrations. Later pages contact only the sources that
hold the page's entities instead of re-broadcasting the query. Maps
expire (`expiresAt`, one hour by default) and are honoured on retrieve
and temporal paths.

A federated map is merged from the maps the Context Sources return, so
what a source sends is held to Table 5.2.39-2 before it becomes part of
a document this broker stores under its own id and serves. A key that is
not an Entity id is dropped, per key rather than per source, and so is
the `@none` a source uses for what it holds locally — that marker is
about the source, and this broker has no Entity id to record it under.
A source's own map id reaches `linkedMaps` only if it is a valid URI,
because it travels back out as the `NGSILD-EntityMap` header of every
later forwarded page; a source without a usable one simply re-runs its
query when the page arrives. One source contributes at most as many
entries as the broker's own page ceiling (5.5.9, 1 000 by default),
which is the ceiling the local half of the map already carries.

## Tenancy across the federation

The client's `NGSILD-Tenant` never propagates to forwards (4.14); a CSR
addresses a specific tenant of a remote source through its `tenant`
member, and the `~`-suffixed alias keeps each (source, tenant) pair
distinct in loop detection. A registration pointing back at the same
broker for another tenant is a legitimate federation shape, not a loop.

## The five-broker stack

The IOP worked example, five brokers and no Docker:

```bash
dev/run-five.sh    # ports 9090..9094, aliases antares1..antares5
```

Each broker gets `ANTARES_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:PORT`; this is the
stack the 286-test IOP tree runs against in CI.
