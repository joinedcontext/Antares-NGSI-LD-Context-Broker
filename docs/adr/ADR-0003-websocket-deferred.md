# ADR-0003: WebSocket binding deferred out of v1

Date: 2026-08-03 · Status: accepted

The draft ngsi-ld-ws binding is NOT implemented in v1. Structural: the
whole binding is scoped to a future `antares-ws` crate behind cargo feature
`ws`, plugging into the NotificationSink scheme registry and a
Router::merge — core crates never change.
Standards-aligned: a WS Notification Binding is an official NGSI-LD 2.1 work
item (ETSI TC DATA Issue #8); implementing ahead of it risks divergence.

## Confirmation

No `antares-ws` crate and no `ws` cargo feature exist in the workspace (`ls crates`, `grep -rn '"ws"' crates/*/Cargo.toml` empty); manual review when the binding is taken up.
