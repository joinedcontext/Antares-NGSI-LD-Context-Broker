# ADR-0005: AnyStore enum + synchronous Pg facade

Date: 2026-08-04 · Status: accepted · enum seam superseded by ADR-0013,
sync facade and its blocking-ceiling amendment superseded by ADR-0022
(the mutate transaction rule stands)

The store seam is a closed enum, not a trait object: `AnyStore { Mem, Pg }`
in `antares-sql`, exposing the v0 memory store's 12-method surface with
`Result`-returning signatures. Two deliberate deviations from the original
design sketch:

1. **Enum, not `dyn EntityStore`.** The closure-based
   `mutate<T, E>(FnOnce(&mut Value) -> Result<T, E>)` is generic — it cannot
   be a trait-object method. A generic trait would force every consumer
   generic over the store; the enum keeps call sites monomorphic and the
   backend set is closed by design (memory/file share one arm, postgres/
   timescale the other). Adding a backend = adding an arm, which the
   compiler then enforces everywhere.
2. **Synchronous facade over sqlx.** `PgBackend` runs its async sqlx calls
   under `block_in_place` (`store/pg/entity.rs::wait`), so all 60+ call
   sites in `antares-api` kept their signatures at the Postgres cutover — no
   async-ification churn, and the closure-based `mutate` maps 1:1 onto the
   `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` → apply-in-Rust → version-bump transaction.

Read-modify-write rule (learned the hard way, ETSI 047_06): **every mutate —
entities AND doc kinds — is one transaction under the row lock, and a
missing row is `None`, never an insert.** A get+upsert mutate lets a
bookkeeping writeback racing a DELETE resurrect the deleted row; the
suite's leftover-subscription failure was exactly that. Regression test:
`antares-sql/tests/pg_doc.rs::mutate_never_resurrects_a_deleted_row`.

Consequence: the facade is the compatibility layer, not the destination —
per-op SQL (UNNEST batches, compiled q= pushdown) lands inside the
Pg arm without touching consumers.

## Confirmation

`crates/antares-store/src/lib.rs typed_mutate_round_trips_through_the_boxed_seam` (the mutate-transaction rule survives the trait seam); the enum half is confirmed by ADR-0013.

## Amendment: the blocking ceiling is sized from the connection cap

`wait` parks the calling thread under `block_in_place`. Past tokio's
blocking-thread ceiling (512 by default) a parked `block_in_place` also
parks the core it ran on, and with every core parked nothing polls the
I/O and timer driver: the pool acquires the threads wait for, and their
5 s timeouts, can never complete and the process stops at zero CPU
(seen at 1 000 updates/s with 12 000 client connections). Driving the
pool from a runtime of its own removes the deadlock but makes every
round trip a cross-thread wakeup (p99 at 500 updates/s went from
49 ms to 2 s), so the sockets stay on the request runtime and the
composition root sizes the ceiling instead: `max_blocking_threads =
ANTARES_MAX_CONNECTIONS + 1024`, one parked caller per served
connection plus the background work (`antares-broker` `runtime`).
Threads are created on demand, so the ceiling costs nothing until a
storm actually uses it. Regression:
`antares-broker` `runtime_tests::callers_beyond_tokio_default_ceiling_still_wake`.
