//! The authorization seam: a policy engine written the way one from outside
//! this repository would be (ADR-0020).
//!
//! Static rules from a JSON document, one entry per tenant. It is
//! deliberately the simplest engine that is USEFUL rather than the most
//! capable: no policy server, no token parsing, no rule language. What it
//! shows is the shape of the seam — that an engine outside `crates/` can
//! deny an operation, narrow a query, project a document and a notification,
//! and that none of it needs a line of core code.
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "acme": {
//!     "denyTypes": ["Secret"],
//!     "omit": ["price"],
//!     "q": "speed<100"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A tenant with no entry is unrestricted. `denyTypes` refuses any operation
//! that names one of those Entity types; `omit` drops those Attributes from
//! every document served and every notification sent; `q` is conjoined into
//! every query the tenant runs.
