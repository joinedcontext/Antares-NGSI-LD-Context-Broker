# Architecture

A map of the Antares NGSI-LD context broker for anyone who has to change
it: what lives where, how a request and a change travel, which invariants
hold the system together, and what to touch for a given kind of change.
The user-facing story is the book under `docs/src/`; irreversible
decisions are in `docs/adr/`; the clause-by-clause conformance ledger is in
`docs/spec/`. This file is the index that links them to code.

Every path below is relative to the repository root. Line counts are
approximate and mark weight, not authority.

## 1. Shape in one paragraph

One binary (`crates/antares-broker`) serves ETSI CIM 009 V1.9.1 over HTTP
(`crates/antares-api`, axum). Handlers negotiate the request
(`negotiate.rs`), await a store trait
(`crates/antares-store`), and return. The store fires a change hook on
every write and awaits it, so the history that write produced is there for
the next read; the hook hands the change
to the notification pipeline (`notify.rs`), which matches subscriptions
from an in-memory mirror and delivers over HTTP or MQTT
(`crates/antares-notifier`). Storage is a ladder behind one trait:
process maps, redb file, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, TimescaleDB
(`crates/antares-sql`). With `ANTARES_BUS=nats` the same binary splits
into roles (api, matcher, notifier, temporal, registry) joined by a
JetStream stream fed from a transactional outbox. The browser build
(`crates/antares-wasm`) runs the same router behind a Service Worker.

## 2. Crates and their contracts

Dependency direction runs one way — `broker → api → {bus, sql, store,
jsonld, ql, matcher, notifier, model}` — and cargo refuses a cycle in it.
What CI adds (`.github/workflows/workspace.yml`, "Shared crates
standalone") is the stronger rule for the five crates a gateway can take on
its own, `model`, `ql`, `jsonld`, `matcher` and `store`: each is built,
tested and documented alone, and its dependency tree may name neither the
broker nor a storage backend (`antares-api`, `antares-broker`,
`antares-sql`, `sqlx`, `axum`, `redb`).

| Crate | Lines | Owns | Must not |
|---|---|---|---|
| `antares-model` | 1 200 | CIM 009 types verbatim (`Entity`, `NgsiError` = Table 6.3.2-1), publishable | depend on anything Antares |
| `antares-ql` | 5 000 | `q=`, `scopeQ`, `geoQ` parsers → typed AST; the in-memory evaluator (`eval`) | know HTTP or SQL |
| `antares-jsonld` | 8 100 | `@context` loader with caches and pinned core contexts, expansion/compaction, structural validation, the one outbound `client_builder` | do business logic |
| `antares-matcher` | 432 | subscription vs entity: selector, conditions, activity, throttling | touch a store |
| `antares-store` | 3 000 | `CurrentStateDriver`, `TemporalDriver` (object-safe, `lib.rs:140`, `:385`), `Kind`, filters/paging (`filter.rs`) | pull a backend |
| `antares-sql` | 9 400 | AST → SQL compiler (`compile/`), migrations, the sqlx drivers (`store/pg/`), the memory/redb drivers (`store/mem/`), `AnyStore` facade (`store/any.rs`) | be called from handlers directly (see §7) |
| `antares-bus` | 760 | `ChangeEvent`, the JetStream bus, subjects | decide who consumes |
| `antares-notifier` | 1 700 | `NotificationSink` (schemes, `parse_endpoint`, `deliver`, `network`) chosen from `SinkRegistry` by endpoint scheme: http (`http.rs`), mqtt behind the feature, delivery policy, `Outbound` | match or store |
| `antares-api` | 49 500 | the HTTP binding: routers, handlers, negotiation, federation, notification pipeline, snapshots, bounds | own a backend or a transport |
| `antares-broker` | 3 800 | composition root: env → config, roles, bus wiring (`wiring.rs`), telemetry, shutdown | contain clause logic |
| `antares-wasm` | 500 | the router under a Service Worker, OPFS-backed file store | diverge from the native router |

## 3. Module map of `antares-api/src`

One module per NGSI-LD resource family; the clause range is in each
module's header comment.

| Module | Lines | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| `lib.rs` | 6 100 | the router (`/ngsi-ld/v1` nest, `/q/*` admin, `/info`), tenant purge, shared helpers |
| `negotiate.rs` | 2 000 | 6.3.4–6.3.6: tenant, Accept, Content-Type, `@context` resolution, parameter allow-lists (the query set of 6.4.3.2 included) and the RFC 7230 header-syntax checks. Every handler passes through `tenant_from`, `check_params`, `parse_body`, `request_context` |
| `entities.rs` | 3 700 | 5.6.1–5.6.6, 5.7.1–5.7.2 `/entities`, distributed write fan-out |
| `paging.rs` | 1 400 | 4.12, 6.3.10 limit/offset/count and the next/prev links, 4.23 ordering and ICU collation, 6.3.17 `NGSILD-Warning`, the query body of 5.2.23 lifted into parameters; every list operation pages through it |
| `attrs.rs` | 1 900 | 5.6.2–5.6.5 attribute operations |
| `batch.rs` | 2 000 | 5.6.7–5.6.10, 5.6.20 `/entityOperations/*` |
| `temporal.rs` | 4 100 | 5.6.11–5.6.16, 5.7.3–5.7.4 `/temporal/entities` |
| `temporalq.rs` | 200 | 5.2.21 `TemporalQ` from the timerel/timeAt/endTimeAt/timeproperty parameters and the 4.11 instance match; named by temporal, csource, federation and subscriptions |
| `types_attrs.rs` | 900 | 5.7.5–5.7.10 `/types`, `/attributes` |
| `subscriptions.rs` | 1 900 | 5.8, 5.11 `/subscriptions`, `/csourceSubscriptions` |
| `notify.rs` | 4 800 | 5.8.6 matching and delivery, the subscription mirror, interval sweeps, csource notifications |
| `distsub.rs` | 1 750 | 5.8.1.4 distributed subscriptions, consumer half |
| `csource.rs` | 2 200 | 5.9, 5.10 registrations, `csource_index` maintenance |
| `registry.rs` | 470 | matching over a registration document: `CsrSpec`, the 4.3.6.1 information match, csf and scope filters, the temporal interval and expiry of a registration, the 5.11.2 subscription match; named by federation, notify, csource and every resource module that forwards |
| `federation.rs` | 3 500 | 4.3.6, 5.12, 6.3.17–6.3.19 forwarding, fan-out, result merge |
| `entity_maps.rs` | 370 | 5.14 the `/entityMaps` resources (6.32, 6.34, 6.35): create from a query, retrieve, update, delete |
| `entity_map.rs` | 850 | one EntityMap document (5.2.39): store it under its tenant with a lifetime, read it back while it lives, take a page's candidate ids from it, merge what a distributed query reached, and serve a retrieve through a presented map |
| `snapshots.rs` | 2 000 | 5.16 snapshots under synthetic `snap-…` tenants |
| `contexts.rs` | 880 | 5.13 `/jsonldContexts` |
| `conformance.rs` | 855 | 6.3.21 version negotiation |
| `repr.rs` | 1 600 | 6.3.7, 4.5.4 representations: normalized, concise, keyValues, sysAttrs; 4.5.23 Linked Entity Retrieval (inline and flat, the lookup budget) and the 4.5.16 GeoJSON Feature/FeatureCollection shapes — what every module needs to render a document |
| `history.rs` | 260 | the producer side of temporal recording: the per-request change buffer and the 4.5.7/4.5.8 delete mirrors that record a deleted Entity or Attribute in history |
| `stamp.rs` | 50 | 4.8, 5.2.4 system attributes of a write: `createdAt`/`modifiedAt` on the entity and on every attribute instance |
| `mirror.rs` | 530 | the change event and the two document mirrors (`Change`, `DocMirror`, `SubMirror`, `TenantIndex`) that state, notify and history share, with the registration index (`reg_keys`, `bucketed`, `matching`) the federation read path selects candidates through; names no other module |
| `bounds.rs` | 718 | every cap: body, URI, JSON depth, batch, fan-out, in-flight, regex program size, and the notification pipeline's queue depth and delivery widths; all reported by `/q/health`, which a test over this module's own source keeps true |
| `egress.rs` | 470 | SSRF wall and per-destination circuit breakers for notifications, forwards, `@context` fetches |
| `surface.rs` | 100 | `ApiSurface`: HTTP surfaces mounted beside the API root, on the reserved prefixes `/q` and `/x` |
| `policy.rs` | 996 | the policy seam (ADR-0020): `PolicyEngine`, `Subject`/`Operation`/`Decision`/`Filter`, the built-in `AllowAll` engine, the clauses a narrowing can reach and the refusal everywhere else, the fail-closed calls that deny on a panic or a timeout, and the stored subject a notification is decided under |
| `state.rs` | 930 | `AppState`: store, bus flag, mirror, HTTP clients, delivery policy, sinks, surfaces, hooks |

Geoquery evaluation, the `q=` evaluator and the caches of compiled client
query text are not in that table because they are not this crate's: they are
`antares_ql::geo`, `::eval` and `::regex`, named by those paths at every call
site here, and the evaluation lives in the crate a gateway can use on its
own. That includes the 4.9 precedence between `expandValues` and `jsonKeys`
(`antares_ql::eval::expansion_list`): the entity query, the temporal query
and a Subscription's notification condition (Table 5.2.12-1) all carry the
pair, and the matcher cannot reach the broker crate, so the rule lives beside
the coercion it feeds.

## 4. A request, end to end

```
TCP accept (broker main.rs, TCP_NODELAY)
 → axum router (api lib.rs)
 → negotiate: tenant header → TenantId, Accept/Content-Type, params allow-list,
   Link/@context → antares_jsonld::Loader (cache, pinned core context)
 → bounds: body size/depth, URI length (rejects are counted in /q/health)
 → handler <resource>.rs::<operation>_inner
     expand (jsonld) → validate (model) → store call (CurrentStateDriver)
     for distributed operations: federation.rs::forward under FED_INFLIGHT
 → respond: compact, representation (repr.rs), paging Link headers, status
```

Handlers await the store: every driver method is an `async fn`
(ADR-0022), object-safe through `#[async_trait::async_trait]`, so a caller
waiting on Postgres holds no thread and store parallelism is bounded by the
connection pool rather than by an OS-thread ceiling. The pool (`ANTARES_PG_POOL`, 20) answers
503 with `Retry-After` after its 5 s acquire timeout — the driver marks a
`PoolTimedOut` with `antares_model::error::DB_OVERLOADED` and
`negotiate::ApiError::Overloaded` renders it — and every transaction opens
through `store/pg/mod.rs::begin`, which times the wait into
`antares_pg_transaction_begin_seconds`; see §8.

## 5. A change, end to end

```
store write commits
 → ChangeHook (set at wiring; api role only)
     history.rs: temporal auto-recording, synchronous, same request
     buffer_change → per-request change buffer → change_flush at response
 → notify.rs::wire: bounded mpsc (CHANGE_QUEUE); a full queue drops and
   counts (antares_notification_changes_dropped_total, warn per thousand)
 → drain task: ONE task, batch → process_changes, the next batch taken
   only once this one's deliveries have all settled (which is what keeps
   per-subscription order); every change in the batch is matched
   sequentially on that task
     match against SubMirror (in memory, per tenant; store list is the
     never-wired fallback), candidates handed over as shared documents and
     each `@context` resolved once per drain and per tenant → group per
     subscription → JoinSet under
     DELIVERY_SLOTS (ANTARES_DELIVERY_WIDTH, default 64)
 → deliver_as: one record_delivery per attempt (timesSent,
   lastNotification, lastSuccess, status), mirror updated from the document
   it returns,
   egress check + breaker for a binding that opens a socket, the
   NotificationSink the registry holds for the endpoint's scheme (never a
   fall-through, ADR-0016), retries as transport (ADR-0015), dead letter on
   exhaustion
```

With `ANTARES_BUS=nats` (`broker/src/wiring.rs`): the api role writes an
outbox row in the same transaction, a drain publishes to the
`ANTARES_CHANGES` stream with `Nats-Msg-Id` = outbox seq; matcher pods
consume, subscriptions travel through a KV bucket to every mirror;
interval firings are claimed through the store so one pod fires. A message
over the 256 KB ceiling carries claim-check references instead of the
bodies: the drain keeps that outbox row (stamped `published_at`, out of
later pages) and the matcher reads the whole event back by its seq, because
the store's current row is the after-image and holds no before-image to
diff against. The maintenance pass frees stamped rows 24 hours on.

## 6. Storage

`ANTARES_STORE=memory|file|postgres|timescale` (ADR-0004), one trait
pair, one schema (`crates/antares-sql/migrations/`: `0001_init.sql`,
`0002_dead_letters.sql`, `0003_comma_seconds_fraction.sql`,
`0004_drop_entity_maps.sql`, `0005_service_escape_by_command.sql`).

- Tenancy: one shared schema, `tenant_id` on every row, Row-Level
  Security with `FORCE` on every tenant table (ADR-0001). RLS is a belt
  only when the role is not a superuser: `ANTARES_REQUIRE_RLS=1` refuses
  to boot otherwise, and the shipped manifests set it. The one hole in
  the belt is the transaction-scoped `antares.service` GUC, which the
  outbox drain and the two 4.22 reaps arm to work across tenants; it
  opens `SELECT` and `DELETE` on `entities`, `outbox` and (plain mode)
  `attr_instances`, and nothing else — the setting is not privileged, so
  the commands it reaches are the whole of its blast radius.
- Documents other than entities (subscriptions, registrations, entity
  maps, snapshots, dist-sub mappings, dead letters) are `Kind`-tagged
  JSON rows with the same trait surface (ADR-0012).
- Queries: `antares-sql/compile/` turns the AST into SQL that NARROWS;
  the in-memory evaluator (`antares-ql::eval`) is the arbiter
  (`qprefilter.rs`). A compiled predicate may be partial; it may never
  drop a candidate.
- Temporal: `attr_instances`, range-partitioned by `observed_at`
  (hypertable under timescale, no RLS there by columnstore constraint,
  ADR-0006); recording is synchronous in the write path (ADR-0007).
- Registrations: candidate matching goes through `csource_index`, never
  a scan of a tenant's registrations. Its rows are a pure function of the
  registration document, rebuilt inside the transaction that writes it and
  only when that write moved a member they are built from: the Table
  5.2.9-2 forward counters move on every distributed operation and are not
  among them.

## 7. Invariants (break one and the suite tells you)

1. Spec names: Rust types and function names come from CIM 009 (`Entity`,
   `create_entity` = 5.6.1). Error variants = Table 6.3.2-1.
2. Doc comments on normative code cite the clause number and the rule.
3. Everything inbound is bounded (`bounds.rs`); everything outbound goes
   through `antares_jsonld::client_builder` and `egress.rs`.
4. No dynamic SQL outside the compiler (CI gate); `unsafe` forbidden;
   `unwrap`/`expect` denied outside tests.
5. Every env variable is in `KNOWN_KEYS` (`broker/src/main.rs`) and in
   `docs/src/configuration.md` (`dev/check-env-docs.sh`). Every version is
   in `[workspace.dependencies]`; the `wasm32` target sections, which
   cannot say `workspace = true` because cargo features are additive, are
   held equal to it by `dev/check-wasm-pins.py`.
6. `/q/health` lists every cap; a new cap is added to the health snapshot
   and its test (`bounds::tests`).
7. A store returns `NgsiError`, never a backend error; a handler never
   formats SQL.
8. Tests that wait for a delivery scale their wait by
   `antares_api::state::slow_factor()` (sanitizer builds run ten times
   slower).
9. The ETSI Robot suite is the oracle, never the requirements source;
   the clause text in `docs/spec/` is.

## 8. Known structural debts

Stated so they are not rediscovered. Each is measured, not guessed.

- Every trait method allocates: `#[async_trait::async_trait]` boxes one
  future per store call (ADR-0022), which is what makes `Arc<dyn
  CurrentStateDriver>` possible at all. Native `async fn` in a trait is
  object-safe only behind a nightly feature; when it lands on stable the
  attribute comes off and the allocation with it, without touching a call
  site.
- Query evaluation is synchronous and the store is not, so the 4.9
  linked-entity terms resolve by cache-and-retry (`notify::linked_eval`):
  the evaluator runs against a cache, the URIs it missed are fetched
  together, and it runs again. A link chain of depth *n* costs *n* passes
  over the expression. The alternative is an async evaluator, which would
  put a store on `antares-ql` and `antares-matcher`.
- `antares-api` is acyclic: no module reaches itself through
  `crate::<module>` references, so the largest strongly connected
  component of its 31 modules is one. What two resources share lives in
  a leaf that names no resource module: the change event and the two
  document mirrors in `mirror.rs`, paging, ordering and the query-body
  lift in `paging.rs`, the request's temporal query in `temporalq.rs`,
  registration matching in `registry.rs`, the system attributes of a
  write in `stamp.rs`, one EntityMap document in `entity_map.rs`, and
  4.5.23 Linked Entity Retrieval with the 4.5.16 GeoJSON shapes in
  `repr.rs`. `dt_key`, `check_attr_name`, `scope_matches`,
  `type_selection_matches` and `redact_userinfo` are named from the
  crates that own them. The one call that pointed back up the pipeline —
  the delivery path handing a notification on the internal endpoint to
  `distsub` — is a seam: `AppState::csource_notification`, installed by
  `antares_api::install_csource_notification`, absent and therefore dropped
  on a state nobody wired. Every root installs it, and the broker does so
  above its bus branch rather than inside one: `antares_api::wire` carries
  the in-process matcher, the role-split fleet wires its matcher through
  `wiring::wire_nats`, and a handler installed in only one of them leaves
  the other accepting distributed Subscriptions that forward no copy.
  `cargo modules` does not show such a cycle because it records call edges
  and not field types, so the source-level count is the one to measure: `dev/module-graph.py` prints
  it per crate and `xray.yml` ratchets the largest component of every
  crate against `dev/module-baseline.json` (`antares-jsonld` holds a
  second one, `context` ↔ `loader`, of two).
- `antares-api` names no storage backend in a normal build: `antares-sql`
  is an optional dependency behind the dev-only `test-kit` and `postgres`
  features (`AppState::new` over the built-in store, the Postgres-backed
  integration tests), the roots compose their drivers with
  `AppState::with_drivers`, and the temporal query's paging decision asks
  `TemporalDriver::q_pushdown_exact`, which only the Postgres arm answers
  from its prefilter. `workspace.yml` checks the dependency tree.
- `csource.rs` serialises registration writes per tenant on process-local
  `tokio::sync::Mutex`es (`REGISTRATION_WRITE`), so the 5.9.2.4 overlap
  check of an idPattern-only registration, which walks up to
  `MAX_UNDECIDED_ROWS` under it, stalls only its own tenant. Two broker
  pods do not exclude each other: a database-level lock held across the
  check-then-write section is the remaining step.
- Every distributed write takes its registrations and the `Via` loop
  answer from `federation::write_plan` (`WritePlan::Forward` or
  `Answered`); the read-path prologue (csf, the two-binding rule) is
  still spelled per query path.
- Oversized functions carrying one clause's whole validation matrix:
  `purge_inner`, `batch_write`, `query_temporal_inner`,
  `normalize_subscription`, `expand_instance`, `normalize_registration`,
  `deliver_as`. Split by member on touch.
- Misplaced helpers: the error constructor `bad` lives in
  `snapshots.rs` and is used crate-wide.
- The pipeline is bounded by matches, not by delivery concurrency. One
  match is one (subscription, entity) pair. `dev/perf/deliver.py` holds
  above 30 000 matches/s on twelve cores at 2.7 cores of broker with
  nothing dropped, and the harness runs out of load before the broker
  does — its writers are threads in one interpreter. Delivery width does
  not govern it either: over a hundred-tenant shape, widths of 8 to 1 024
  deliver the same 7 027 matches/s and drop nothing, so the knob has
  nothing to arbitrate while the offered load is absorbed whole. Matching
  is still sequential on the single drain task above, which is where the
  next lever sits if a deployment ever offers more than this harness can.
- Goodput goes backwards past the write knee, and nothing sheds load
  before it. Against PostgreSQL the same ladder that delivers 1 671
  changes per second when offered 2 000 delivers 1 140 when offered
  4 000, with broker CPU falling from 1.39 cores to 1.26 as it does: the
  writers keep arriving, the database is past what it can commit, and the
  broker is starved rather than busy. The bounded matcher queue protects
  the notification path, and nothing plays that role for writes. This
  sits under the delivery path rather than in it — no change to matching
  or delivery moves it. The rented rig shows the same shape from the
  other side: at 500 rps offered, where the shape asks for about 8 900
  notifications a second, the pipeline delivers 561 a second and sheds
  26 398 changes, against the 3 251 a second the same build sustains at
  200 rps. Past the queue's capacity the system delivers an order of
  magnitude less than its own sustained rate rather than settling at it.
- Per-notification cost is one row update. The Postgres arm writes it as
  a single statement (`pg::doc::record_delivery`), so the row lock is held
  for the statement rather than across a round trip and the Rust closure —
  at fan-out that hold time is what serializes delivery on a hot
  subscription. Batching several attempts into one statement was recorded
  here as the next lever; it is not, on the evidence above — it shortens a
  per-delivery cost that sits downstream of the ceiling. It stays unbuilt,
  and `set_config` being the RLS context still makes any such batch
  per tenant by construction.
- Registration candidate selection reads on the order of a thousand
  rows per federated query on a 10 000-registration registry; the
  `csource_index` needs a type-first shape.
- Duplication has a measured floor rather than a target of zero.
  `dev/dup-check.sh` ratchets the workspace at 64 token clones over 751
  lines (`dev/dup-baseline.json`), 552 of them in `antares-api`, and at 13
  groups of functions sharing one signature. What the ratchet still allows:
  - 35 lines are `use` blocks in files serving neighbouring clauses. A
    `use` list is not logic, and a shared prelude would hide what each
    module depends on.
  - 51 lines are the Entity Type List and Attribute List discovery
    operations (5.7.5, 5.7.6). That parallel is the specification's: the
    two build different representations from different tables
    (5.2.24/5.2.25 against 5.2.27/5.2.28), so one generic over both would
    take more parameters than it removes and would let a change to one
    table reshape the other.
  - The largest remaining share is per-operation handler heads and tails,
    nine to fifteen lines each. What those share is already extracted --
    `tenant_from`, `check_params`, `request_context`,
    `ParsedBody::object`, `attach_paging`, `entity_maps::retrieve_with_map`
    -- and what remains is the part that differs: the parameter
    vocabulary, the error type of Table 6.3.2-1, the forwarded operation
    name. Fifty `check_params` call sites carry twenty-one distinct
    allowlists, and only two share the eleven-name query prefix; one
    allowlist for operations whose allowlists deliberately differ would
    widen what each endpoint accepts.
  - Three signature groups are coincidences of shape rather than shared
    logic: `check_ring`, `check_position` and `check_vertex_budget` all
    take a `&Value` and return `Result<(), String>` while validating three
    unrelated rules (RFC 7946 ring closure, WGS84 range, a vertex budget),
    `temporal_key` and `pattern_regex` are both
    `(&str) -> Option<String>` over different vocabularies, and
    `SubMirror::apply` and `DocMirror::apply` are the two implementations
    of `Mirror::apply`, so that signature is the trait's rather than a
    repetition: one keeps an inverted candidate index in step with the
    document it stores, the other only stores the document. Merging any of
    them would name one function after two rules.
  - One signature group is the reference plugin's, and stays: because
    `examples/plugin-example` implements the same two driver traits as the
    in-binary memory store, its `live`, `rows` and `emit` necessarily carry
    the memory store's signatures. That is the seam being demonstrated, so
    the ratchet holds it at thirteen rather than twelve.
  - Three clusters are real debt, each reading one rule more than once:
    the temporal writes (80 lines inside `temporal.rs`, `add_temporal_attrs`
    against `upsert_temporal` and `delete_temporal_instance` against
    `delete_temporal_attr`), the federation entry points (72 lines,
    `fed_query`/`fed_query_temporal`, `fed_retrieve`/`fed_retrieve_temporal`
    and `import_entity`/`import_temporal`) and the snapshot document
    handlers (24 lines across `retrieve_snapshot`, `update_snapshot` and
    `clone_snapshot`).

## 9. To change X, touch Y

| Change | Touch | Also |
|---|---|---|
| a new query parameter | `negotiate.rs` allow-list, the handler, `antares-ql` if it has grammar | a `docs/spec/` ledger entry, a Robot TP |
| a new NGSI-LD resource | `<resource>.rs` + route in `lib.rs` | `Kind` in `antares-store` if it is stored |
| an error status | `antares-model` `NgsiError` | Table 6.3.2-1 in the doc comment |
| a cap | `bounds.rs` + env key + `docs/src/configuration.md` | `/q/health` test |
| a store backend | implement both driver traits in a new crate | a name on `store_shelf()` behind its feature (`examples/plugin-example` is the worked one); a built-in also takes a `StoreMode` value, an `AnyStore` arm and a CI cell |
| a notification transport | `NotificationSink` impl (own crate, or `antares-notifier`) | `SinkRegistry::register` at the composition root; `network()` false only if it opens no socket |
| outbound HTTP anywhere | `antares_jsonld::client_builder` only | egress policy and breaker; the DNS pin and the redirect cap live there and nowhere else, and `workspace.yml` fails on a client built any other way. reqwest is built provider-less, so a client built by another spelling panics rather than merely escaping the policy; `main` installs the provider before the OTLP exporter builds one of its own |
| a schema change | a new numbered migration; never edit an applied one | RLS policy + `FORCE` on the table |
| federation behaviour | `federation.rs` (`forward` is the one outbound chokepoint) | 4.3.6 narrowing is spec-mandated; keep it |
| the bus or roles | `broker/src/wiring.rs` | ADR-0002 |
| a role's HTTP surface | `lib.rs` router construction by `roles` | a worker must 404 the API |
| another standard's API beside NGSI-LD (SensorThings, OGC API, WFS) | an `ApiSurface` under `/x/…` in its own crate that calls `AppState::call` — the in-process handle over this broker's own router, built once per state on first use | never under `/ngsi-ld/`; every façade request is an NGSI-LD request, so negotiation, bounds and tenancy are not repeated. The handle carries `NGSILD-Tenant`, `NGSILD-Snapshot`, `Link` and the policy subject headers from the caller, so a façade cannot be the way around any of them |
| an authorization decision | no engine in the broker: `policy.rs` is the seam one attaches to, and the gateway keeps authentication and rate limiting (`docs/src/shared-crates.md`, "The PEP boundary") | conformance is asserted against the built-in allow-all engine, the way `surface.rs` refuses a surface under the API root |
| an NGSI-LD operation | one `policy::gate` call where the request enters its handler, naming the clause | exactly once per request: the shared query engines below a handler (`query_entities_inner`, `query_temporal_inner`) never gate, and `tests/policy_gate_seam.rs` walks every route of `router()` to prove both halves |
| a broker-held record of one query that outlives its request (an EntityMap, a Snapshot, a Subscription) | the subject it was made for, stored in `__subject` and read back through `policy::belongs_to` | the record is reused later, by a request the seam decides separately: a map's `entityMap` member is the id set a narrowing withholds, a snapshot's fill runs after its request is answered, and a notification has no request at all. The `__` prefix is the broker's — `policy::strip_internal` is the one serve-side filter, so a member added later is hidden by construction |
| a narrowing policy decision | the `Filter` the gate returned, applied where the request's own query and representation are built: `Filter::narrow_params` before the store is asked, `repr::narrow_projection` before the document is rendered | a served document is never re-walked to strip a member — the request's own 5.5.2 `pick`/`omit` machinery carries the policy's, so the two projections cannot disagree, and the `q` is conjoined on the `antares-ql` AST so the store push-down, the 5.7.2.4 re-check and the forwarded query read one query. `Filter::project` is the reference semantics the addon contract holds an engine against, not the served path |

## 10. Verification ladder

Unit (`cargo test -p <crate> <filter> -j 2`) → clause Robot TPs against
one local memory broker (`ANTARES_HTTP_PORT=9377 target/debug/antares`,
`ngsi-ld-test-suite/`) → `ci.yml` (dispatch: workspace tests, clippy
wall, quick ETSI matrix) → `full.yml` (seven store cells, twice weekly)
→ `strict.yml` (TSan, Miri, fuzz replay, coverage floor) →
`perf-weekly.yml` / `scale-weekly.yml` (rented hardware, `dev/perf/`).
`dev/code-xray.sh` writes module and call graphs under `results/x-ray/`.

## 11. Reading order for a newcomer

`docs/src/introduction.md` → this file → `docs/adr/` (0001, 0002, 0004,
0005, 0013, 0015) → `crates/antares-api/src/negotiate.rs` →
`entities.rs::create_entity` → `notify.rs::wire` →
`crates/antares-sql/src/store/pg/entity.rs` → `broker/src/wiring.rs`.
