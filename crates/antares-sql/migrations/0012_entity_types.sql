-- The type catalogue: every type a Tenant's Entities ever carried,
-- one row each, kept by the writes themselves. `/types` reads the names
-- here and asks the types index once per name whether a live
-- Entity still carries it, instead of a DISTINCT over every Entity's `types`
-- (66 ms per 100 000 Entities, 30 s and a 503 on a loaded deployment).
--
-- Only an insert, or an update that changes `types`, writes; the row of a
-- type already listed is left alone (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` takes no lock
-- on it), so writers of one type never queue on its row. A delete leaves the
-- name; the liveness check hides it, and a Tenant holds few distinct types.
-- Numbered 0012 after 0011: sqlx applies an unapplied lower
-- version after a higher one.

-- The catalogue's liveness check: a skip scan of the first-type btree finds

-- Entities, which a partial GIN holds alone. The plain types GIN built a
-- bitmap of every Entity of each type (18 ms for five types of 20 000).
