-- One btree for the history instead of two. i_attr_instances_lookup
-- (tenant_id, entity_id, attr_id, observed_at DESC) served the reads and
-- u_attr_instances (tenant_id, entity_id, attr_id, instance_id, observed_at)
-- the upsert's conflict: on a large deployment 9.0 GB + 7.6 GB of a 30 GB
-- weekly partition, ~720 B of a 1.25 KB row. u_attr_instances_time holds the same columns with
-- observed_at before instance_id: its (tenant, entity, attr) prefix with an
-- observed_at range is the lookup read backwards, and ON CONFLICT infers it
-- from the column set, whatever the order.

-- A database with history to rebuild is left as it is: building either index
-- here would hold writes for the length of a scan of the whole history. The
-- maintenance job (store/pg/maintenance.rs `history_one_index`) builds the
-- new one partition by partition with CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY and swaps
-- them in one short transaction. A timescale hypertable with history keeps
-- both indexes: timescale builds a unique index on all chunks at once only.
