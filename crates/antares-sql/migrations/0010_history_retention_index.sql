-- The Entities that carry their own history retention: the retention sweep
-- reads them across every Tenant once a minute
-- (store/pg/maintenance.rs `history_overrides`), and the key is a literal, so
-- a partial index holds exactly that set and costs every other write nothing.
--
-- On entities, not attr_instances (see 0009's note): building it is one
-- scan of current state (626 MB on a large deployment, a few seconds of
-- writes waiting at upgrade), never of the history.
