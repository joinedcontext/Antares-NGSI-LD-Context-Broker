-- Two index paths of a typed read the broker's role can use under RLS
-- (measured on a 1000-distinct-value rig, 581 000 Entities, ten types):
--
-- `i_entities_type_location_cell`: a geoquery of one type. Its cover over
-- `i_entities_location_cell` (0015) holds every type in the cells, and the
-- type was a filter after it: a near/within page of 20 read 17 000-47 000
-- rows of other types, 0.1-0.9 s each. With the type in the key the cover
-- reads only the asked type's rows.
--
-- `i_entities_type_unlocated`: the Entities of a type without `location`.
-- `!location` (the Entities without a geometry) is a negated `@?`, never an
-- index condition, so it read the whole type for no row: 64 000 rows,
-- 68 ms, on every such page.
-- The store ANDs `location IS NULL` to it, true of every Entity `!location`
-- matches (store/pg/entity.rs `unlocated`); that conjunct is leakproof and
-- this partial index holds exactly its rows.
--
-- An index changes no access: RLS and every query's own WHERE are untouched.
