-- The attribute catalogue: every (type, member name) pair a
-- Tenant's Entities ever carried, one row each, kept by the writes. `/types`
-- with details and `/attributes` read the pairs here and probe a few
-- Entities per type through the caller's view, instead of folding every
-- Entity of the Tenant (13-19 s for `/attributes` on a large deployment).
--
-- One statement trigger per INSERT and per UPDATE reads the statement's
-- rows from its transition table and lists their distinct pairs at once, so
-- a batch of 100 Entities of one shape probes entity_attrs' key a dozen times, not
-- 1 200. Its cost is pulling the member names out of each written document:
-- 8-15 us a 12-member Entity under EXPLAIN ANALYZE, where a row trigger
-- comparing OLD and NEW took 26-64 us (20 000 Entities).
-- `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` takes no lock on a pair already listed; two
-- transactions inserting the same new pair wait on each other's unique index
-- entry until the first commits, once per pair, and ORDER BY makes them take
-- new pairs in one order, so they never deadlock. A removed member or a deleted
-- Entity leaves its pairs; the read checks each against a live Entity.
-- The member names are the document's keys, the Entity frame (id, type,
-- createdAt...) included: the reader drops those, as the fold does.
-- Numbered 0025: 0021-0024 landed first.
