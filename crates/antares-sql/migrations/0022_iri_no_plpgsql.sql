-- iri_no in PL/pgSQL. The LANGUAGE sql body of 0020 has a FROM, so
-- the planner never inlines it, and PostgreSQL 17 plans a SQL function's
-- body again in every statement that calls it: ~0.16 ms a call, 17 calls a
-- keyed history write (pg_stat_user_functions). PL/pgSQL keeps
-- the plan for the session. Same signature, volatility and invoker's
-- rights: RLS on iri_ids still applies, and as a STABLE index condition it
-- is still evaluated once per scan.
