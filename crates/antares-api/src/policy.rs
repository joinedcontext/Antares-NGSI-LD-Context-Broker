//!
//! The broker takes no authorization decision of its own. It asks the

//! deliberately narrow: allow, deny, or narrow the operation. Nothing here

//!
//! Everything in this module is core code, compiled and tested in every

//! `crates/`, behind an off-by-default `antares-broker` feature.
//!
//! The seam fails closed: an engine that errors, panics or runs past
//! [`TIMEOUT`] denies. A deployment that wires in a broken engine loses
//! service, never its access rules.
