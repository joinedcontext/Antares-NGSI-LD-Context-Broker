//! The in-process router handle: the seam a façade for another standard
//! (SensorThings, OGC API, WFS, OData) is built on.
//!
//! A façade is an `ApiSurface` under `/x/<standard>` that translates its own
//! request into an NGSI-LD one and calls `AppState::call`. The point of the
//! design is that there is NO second data path: the inner request takes the
//! same route as one off the socket, so everything CIM 009 puts in that path
//! — negotiation, the bounds wall, tenancy (6.3.14), the `@context` a `Link`
//! names (6.3.5), the policy seam — applies to the façade's caller exactly
//! as it applies to an NGSI-LD client. This file holds that: what the
//! handle carries, that it reaches the real handler, and that a façade
//! cannot spend more of the broker's caps than a socket client can.
