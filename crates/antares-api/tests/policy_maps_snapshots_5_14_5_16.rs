//! An EntityMap and a Snapshot under a policy (ADR-0020).
//!
//! Both resources are a broker-held record of what one query matched, and
//! both outlive the request that made them — which is what makes them worth
//! a rule of their own.
//!
//! 5.5.14 gives the EntityMap one: "If an EntityMap has expired, or cannot
//! be accessed, no inference can be made as to which entities are held
//! within the Context Sources and a new one shall be created." A map built
//! for another subject cannot be accessed by this one, so the clause's own
//! recovery applies — a new map, not an error, because the map id arrived in
//! a header and an error would confirm that someone else's transaction
//! exists. The same clause makes exactly one allowance in the other
//! direction: other components "shall only be allowed to update the expiry
//! timestamp of the EntityMap", so an update by a stranger stays open where
//! a retrieve and a delete do not — 5.14.1.4 and 5.14.3.4 answer an id that
//! "does not correspond to any existing EntityMap" with ResourceNotFound,
//! and from a subject that did not build it, that is what the map is.
//!
//! 5.16 gives the Snapshot the other rule. Create, Clone and Purge act on
//! everything the tenant holds — 5.16.1.4 copies whatever the snapshot's
//! queries match, in a fill that runs after the request has been answered —
//! and there is no narrowed form of that. An engine that answers with a
//! narrowing is refused, the way 5.6.21 Purge Entities is.
