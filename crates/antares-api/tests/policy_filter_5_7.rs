//! The seam's third answer is `Filter`: the engine allows the operation over
//! less than it asked for. Three clauses decide what "less" means here.
//!
//! 5.7.2.4 gives the query its filters — "the filter conditions specified by
//! the query" — and the narrowing is one more condition conjoined into them,
//! so an Entity the subject may not see is simply not in the result set.
//! 5.7.1.4 answers a retrieve of one Entity, and an Entity outside the
//! narrowing has to answer the way an absent one does: "If the NGSI-LD
//! Entity does not exist, an error of type ResourceNotFound shall be
//! raised". Telling a caller apart from that would leak the row.
//!
//! 4.21 gives the projection language `pick` and `omit` are written in, and
//! 6.5.3.1 what they do: `omit` removes "the listed Entity members" and
//! `pick` reduces the Entity "down to only contain the listed Entity
//! members". A policy `pick` keeps `id` and `type` besides — 5.2.4 makes
//! them the Entity, and a document without them is not one.
